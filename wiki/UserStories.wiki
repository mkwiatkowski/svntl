== LOC changes per time ==
Graph of how LOC changes during whole project development. X-axis represent time (since revision 1 commit time to last revision commit time) and Y-axis - LOC. Binary files should be omitted.

=== Getting a list of revisions from Subversion repository ===

Via standard 'svn' command using '--xml -v log' arguments. We need an XML parser, which will probably be stdlib's REXML.

=== Counting LOC of the whole project for given revision ===

Going hardcore and doing 'svn cat' for each file in a revision seems like an overkill. I'm thinking about doing 'svn diff' between revisions and calculating number of added/deleted lines by looking at diff chunk headers (looking like: _@@ -28,19 +28,26 @@_). It has also this nice feature that Subversion doesn't diff binary files, so we have these automatically excluded. I need confirmation that this technique will work.
