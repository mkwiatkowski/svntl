== LOC changes per time ==
Graph of how LOC changes during whole project development. X-axis represent time (since revision 1 commit time to last revision commit time) and Y-axis - LOC. Binary files should be omitted.

=== Getting a list of revisions from Subversion repository ===

Via standard 'svn' command using '--xml -v log' arguments. We need an XML parser, which will probably be stdlib's REXML.

=== Counting LOC of the whole project for given revision ===

Going hardcore and doing 'svn cat' for each file in a revision seems like an overkill. I'm thinking about doing 'svn diff' between revisions and calculating number of added/deleted lines by looking at the diff output. There exist [http://viewvc.tigris.org/source/browse/viewvc/trunk/bin/svndbadmin?rev=1288&view=markup a sample python script] for doing that, so it won't be hard to implement. Actual algorithm would execute `svn diff -rREV1:REV2 --diff-cmd "diff" -x "--normal"` and grep for `^<` and `^>`.

=== Generating a graph of LOC/time ===
